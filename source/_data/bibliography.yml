    This is not your average programming book.

    We understand that all kinds of people build websites these days
    (and that they don’t all have a degree in computer science).

    So, if you want to use JavaScript to make your web pages more
    interactive, interesting, and usable, we can help. Even if you
    have never done any programming.

    Computers are everywhere, on every desk, in your iPod, cell phone,
    and PDA. To live well in the 21st century, you need to know how to
    make computers do things. And to really make computers do what you
    want, you have to learn to program.

    Fortunately, that’s easier now than ever before. Chris Pine’s book
    will teach you how to program. You’ll learn to use your computer
    better, to get it to do what you want it to do. Starting with
    small, simple one-line programs to calculate your age in seconds,
    you’ll see how to advance to fully structured, real
    programs. You’ll learn the same technology used to drive modern
    dynamic websites and large, professional applications.

    It’s now easier to learn to write your own computer software than
    it has ever been before. Now everyone can learn to write programs
    for themselves—-no previous experience is necessary. Chris takes a
    thorough, but light-hearted approach that teaches you how to
    program with a minimum of fuss or bother.

    Web development is constantly changing, and you need to stay on
    top of your game. Discover a wide spectrum of web development
    techniques, from how to improve the way you present content, to
    solutions for data analysis, testing, and deployment.

    In this edition we introduce new tools, add new recipes, and
    modernize old ones. You’ll use Vagrant to automate server setup,
    and you’ll discover new ways to develop blogs and static
    sites. You’ll learn how to use Grunt to script the deployment of
    your web project, and use Angular to build a single-page app.

    You’ll learn how to make content stand out with simple
    cross-browser styles; create animations that work well everywhere
    without plugins; and create lightweight, responsive layouts. We’ll
    show you how to use preprocessors like CoffeeScript and Sass;
    write tests for your code; use Git and Dropbox to collaborate;
    configure and secure the Apache web server; use virtualization to
    set up your own servers automatically; and much more.

    Whether you’re new to front-end development, or you’ve got a few
    years of experience, you’ll become a more versatile developer by
    finding out how – and why – to use these solutions in your next
    project.

  abstract: |

    The real challenge of programming isn't learning a language's
    syntax—it's learning to creatively solve problems so you can build
    something great. In this one-of-a-kind text, author V. Anton
    Spraul breaks down the ways that programmers solve problems and
    teaches you what other introductory books often ignore: how to
    Think Like a Programmer. Each chapter tackles a single programming
    concept, like classes, pointers, and recursion, and open-ended
    exercises throughout challenge you to apply your knowledge. You'll
    also learn how to:

    - Split problems into discrete components to make them easier to solve
    - Make the most of code reuse with functions, classes, and libraries
    - Pick the perfect data structure for a particular job
    - Master more advanced programming tools like recursion and dynamic memory
    - Organize your thoughts and develop strategies to tackle particular types of problems

    Although the book's examples are written in C++, the creative
    problem-solving concepts they illustrate go beyond any particular
    language; in fact, they often reach outside the realm of computer
    science. As the most skillful programmers know, writing great code
    is a creative art—and the first step in creating your masterpiece
    is learning to Think Like a Programmer.

    Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby (POODR) is a programmers
    tale about how to write object-oriented code.

    Written by Sandi Metz, it explains object-oriented design (OOD)
    using realistic, understandable examples.  POODR is a practical,
    readable introduction to how OOD can lower your costs and improve
    your applications.

    POODR will help you:
      - Decide what belongs in a single class
      - Avoid entangling objects that should be kept separate
      - Define flexible interfaces among objects
      - Reduce programming overhead costs with duck typing
      - Successfully apply inheritance
      - Build objects via composition
      - Design cost-effective tests
      - Craft simple, straightforward, understandable code

    If your code is killing you and the joy is gone, POODR has the cure.

    A note on pronunciation: Think pooder, as if you were a three year
    old attempting to say computer.  Please don’t think anything else,
    though you may smile as you say it if you like.
