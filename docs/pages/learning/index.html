<h1>Resources for learning how to program, especially how to program in Ruby and Rails </h1>
<p><em>Last updated: 2015-05-31 18:11</em></p>
</header>

<article>
<p>Many people ask me “How do I learn to program?” and “What book(!)
should I read to learn Rails?”.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I’ve created a section for the
<a href="/pages/learning/beginner">Absolute Beginner</a> as well,
you might find it useful.</p>

<p>These are legitimate questions, but they aren’t necessarily the right
questions to ask in order to begin the journey of becoming a software
craftsperson.</p>

<p>Better questions, I feel, are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What resources do you recommend for beginners?</li>
  <li>Where can I go for help?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been finding things around the ‘net that can greatly help people
new to programming, new to web development, new to Rails, and so on.</p>

<hr />

<p>This is a quick, short list of things. I urge you to seek them out,
and seek out others as well, and create your <em>own</em> list of learning
resources. People will begin to ask you, and it’s nice to have
something handy.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/blog/this-is-why-learning-rails-is-hard">learning Rails is hard</a>.
But don’t despair! The key to learning is break things down, focusing
and practicing small things, and build up a lot of skills
slowly. (“Wax on, wax off.” “Ok, Mr. Myagi.”) I’m going to jump ahead
and tell you to download the first chapter (free) of Justin Weiss’s
book
<a href="https://www.justinweiss.com/practicing-rails/">Practicing Rails</a>. Search
for “first chapter” and fill out the form to get it. You’re also
signing up to get e-mail from Justin, but it’s always good stuff.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Update Sun Jun 8 11:39:13 2014:</em> Recently came across web post
 <a href="http://astonj.com/tech/best-way-to-learn-ruby-rails/">Best Way To Learn Ruby and Rails</a>
 and must say it is a great compilation of resources. In addition,
 Ashton puts the focus right at the heart of the matter: you have
 learn <em>both</em> Ruby <em>and</em> Rails.</p>

<h1 id="books">Books</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13590009-think-like-a-programmer"><strong>Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving</strong></a>
by V. Anton Spraul.</p>

    <p>Spraul’s purpose in this book is not to teach you how to write a
program, but to begin to understand the problem-solving approach
that is inherent in good programmers. Like so many skills,
programming is driven by the desire and vision of the
practitioner. A painter uses brushes, canvas, paints, other media to
create a work of art, but it isn’t the tools, it isn’t the specific
techniques, and it isn’t even the particular skill the painter has
that makes a good work of art; it is their composition, the melding
of media and surface, the use of different techniques, and practice
in developing the skills that come together to form the work of
art. Spraul is going to take you deeper than just the syntax,
semantics, and data structures of software to the heart of what
makes a good programmer: the ability to creatively find and generate
solutions to problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/520.Learn_to_Program"><strong>Learn to Program</strong></a>
by Chris Pine.</p>

    <p>To be honest, I have not looked through this book. It is, however,
nearly universally recommended to people new to programming. The
original tutorial is available online for free as well:
<a href="https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/</a>. LtP
was featured on the great webcomic
<a href="http://www.unshelved.com/2014-7-25">Unshelved</a>.</p>

  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language"><strong>A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction</strong></a>
by Christopher Alexander.</p>

    <p>You may be wondering why I’ve included a book on building
construction. The answer is quite simple: the concepts in building
towns and houses is nearly directly translatable to building
software applications and systems. One part of being an excellent
craftsperson is being able to apply abstract learning in different
problem domains. If you are an expert in writing software, you are
almost <em>never</em> going to be solving problems only for other software
developers. (You can and should do so, but the client and users are
generally non-programmers.) Thus you’re most likely going to be
working in someone else’s domain of expertise. Alexander’s views on
architecture apply to software architecture as well.</p>

    <p><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510046.do"><strong>Beautiful Code</strong></a> by Andy Oram and Greg Wilson.</p>

    <p>A book with a purpose, that isn’t a how to, so much as a how to
think. The forward speaks eloquently to my purpose with this blog
and web site:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I got my first job as a programmer in the summer of 1982. Two weeks
after I started, one of the system administrators loaned me Kernighan
and Plauger’s The Elements of Programming Style (McGraw-Hill) and
Wirth’s Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs (Prentice Hall). They
were a revelation—for the first time, I saw that programs could be
more than just instructions for computers. They could be as elegant as
well-made kitchen cabinets, as graceful as a suspension bridge, or as
eloquent as one of George Orwell’s essays.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time and again since that summer, I have heard people bemoan the
fact that our profes- sion doesn’t teach students to see
this. Architects are taught to look at buildings, and com- posers
study one another’s scores, but programmers—they look at each other’s
work only when there’s a bug to fix; even then, they try to look at as
little as possible. We tell stu- dents to use sensible variable names,
introduce them to some basic design patterns, and then wonder why so
much of what they write is so ugly.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This book is our attempt to fix this. In May 2006, I asked some
well-known (and not so well-known) software designers to dissect and
discuss the most beautiful piece of code they knew. As this book
shows, they have found beauty in many different places. For some, it
lives in the small details of elegantly crafted software. Others find
beauty in the big picture—in how a program’s structure allows it to
evolve gracefully over time, or in the techniques used to build it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wherever they find it, I am grateful to our contributors for taking
time to give us a tour. I hope that you enjoy reading this book as
much as Andy and I have enjoyed editing it, and that it inspires you
to create something beautiful, too.</p>

<h2 id="ruby-specific">Ruby-specific</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9364729-eloquent-ruby"><strong>Eloquent Ruby</strong></a>
by Russ Olsen.</p>

    <p>Olsen’s approach in this book is to go far beyond just learning a
programming language, but a way to learning the idioms and the “Ruby
Way”. Even if your chosen language is something other than Ruby,
reading this book will give you an appreciation for how to delve
into a language and get the most out of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.confidentruby.com/"><strong>Confident Ruby</strong></a> by Avdi Grimm.</p>

    <p>More than any other book I’ve read on Ruby, “Confident Ruby” has
affected my coding habits more than any other. If Ruby is about
making programmers happy, <em>Confident Ruby</em> is about making
programming joyful, and not just in the immediate, but being able to
look at code you’ve written in the future and recall the
joy. <em>Confident Ruby</em> seeks to combat software rot from the get-go.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1617291692"><strong>Well-Grounded Rubyist</strong></a>
by David A. Black</p>

    <p>Also known as the “Black Book” (because of the author’s name), WGR
is the successor to <em>Ruby for Rails</em> by Black that provided me with
the much-needed introduction to how to write Ruby code, with the
idea of using it in Ruby for Rails. This book is a fabulous primer
on the Ruby idioms and expressions that help make one a good Ruby
programmer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.poodr.com/"><strong>Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</strong></a>
by Sandi Metz</p>

    <p>This book provides a deeply-needed introduction to object-oriented
design, specifically targeted to the Ruby language. Ruby is one of
the richest languages in which to express object-oriented patterns,
but it is easy to fall of the OO wagon and start to get things
messed up. Sandi provides the thinking tools necessary to decide how
to structure your code for better maintainability, extensibility and
testability. Comprehension and forward communication of the choices
made during software design are crucial to programming, and Sandi is
one of the very best at explaining things.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rails-specific">Rails-specific</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.manning.com/bigg2/"><strong>Rails 4 in Action</strong></a> by Ryan Bigg,
Yehuda Katz, Steve Klabnik, and Rebecca Skinner.</p>

    <p>A follow-on the highly successful Rails 3 in Action, R4iA has been
completely rewritten, with new examples, case study, and all the
great new features in Rails 4.</p>

    <p>A great book for beginning Rails developers to start with, and for
intermediate developers to step up their game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.justinweiss.com/practicing-rails/"><strong>Practicing Rails</strong></a>
 by <a href="http://www.justinweiss.com">Justin Weiss</a>.</p>

    <p>The first chapter alone (free!) is worth a download and very
thorough read. Justin has provided one of the most effective
strategies for learning just about <em>anything</em> skill based, and it’s
especially effective for learning software skills. The focus of the
book and the examples and such are obviously Rails, but the first
chapter is applicable to anything.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="javascript-specific">JavaScript-specific</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2998152-javascript"><strong>JavaScript: The Good Parts</strong></a>
by David Crockford.</p>

    <p>JavaScript is a vast, sprawling language and ecosystem, and has been
maligned for much poor code on the web. Crockford extracts out the
parts that are really useful, giving the reader a better
grounding. This book is the progenitor of many of the JavaScript
frameworks that have come up the past few years, as well as
CoffeeScript and other *Script derivatives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS"><strong>You Don’t Know JS series</strong></a>
by <a href="https://github.com/getify">Kyle Simpson</a>.</p>

    <p>A <em>tour de force</em> by one of the great teachers and evangelists of
JavaScript, Kyle’s “You Don’t Know JS” series is a must-read
collection of books. You can get the books in raw form on-line at
the above address, and you can get the published e-books at your
favourite vendor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/"><strong>Eloquent Javascript</strong></a> by Marijn
Haverbeke.</p>

    <p>When I was more naive about JS, I wrote a bit of a negative review
of this book. Subsequently, I’ve learned of it’s true eloquence and
meaning in giving a model of how to organize and implement modern
JS. The subtitle “A modern introduction to programming” is still a
bit misleading, perhaps, because you have to understand a fair bit
of JavaScript <em>and</em> programming to get the message, I feel. But
that’s just a quibble at this point. Read this before you strike out
on creating a client-based JS application; you won’t regret it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="html-and-css-specific">HTML and CSS Specific</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0"><strong>HTML and CSS Design and Build Websites</strong></a> by Jon Duckett.</p>

    <p>This book has been recommended by several people in the [GDI] courses
I’ve been helping in. A very visual approach, using full-colour photographs
to explain the two declarative languages.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="web-sites">Web sites</h1>

<p>This is just going to be a list of sites I’ve found or been pointed at
for helping people learn to program. These are most definitely biased
towards Ruby and Rails, as that is my current area of concentration,
and generate the most requests that come to me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/home"><strong>The Odin Project</strong></a> –
pulling together a curriculum from around the web, this is a
curation site that gives order and structure to learning how to
develop web applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://codekata.com/"><strong>Code Kata</strong></a> – Dave Thomas’s site that
lists a great set of coding exercises. You can work these more than
once, in fact that is what you do with kata.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://exercism.io/"><strong>Exercism.IO</strong></a> – a site devoted to helping
people learn and think deeply about writing excellent code. It has
projects you implement and then get feedback on from others, and
allows you to give feedback as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://docs.railsbridge.org/docs/"><strong>RailsBridge</strong></a> – a site
devoted to helping people get up and running on learning Ruby on
Rails, with emphasis on reaching out to women and LGBTQ
folks. RailsBridge workshops are run around the world and the
documents here can be used individually to help turn your computer
into a development machine. What so often isn’t addressed directly
by very many of these sites and books is the ecosystem that one has
to learn as well: a coding editor, the command line, rake, irb/pry,
git, heroku if that is your choice for deployment (which I do
recommend for small beginner projects so you can show it off to your
friends); RailsBridge tutorials include these very important tools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/"><strong>RailsGirls Guides</strong></a> – I haven’t
explored these in depth yet, I just got the site yesterday. However,
I can see just from the list of guides these would be pretty great,
just like the RailsBridge site above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/"><strong>Hartl’s Rails Tutorial</strong></a> – the
most often recommended site to learn how to create web applications
in Rails, it goes beyond the Rails stack itself, teaching Ruby,
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, user authentication and authorization, data
modeling, and so on. While Michael sells the book, tutorials, and
screen casts, the text of the tutorial online is free at
http://www.railstutorial.org/book. Considerable work has gone into
this effort, however, so if you can afford to, please purchase at
least the book.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/"><strong>CodeSchool</strong></a> – learn from the
“Comfort of your own browser”. Codeschool has web casts, coding
practices, challenges, and so on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://codeacademy.com"><strong>CodeAcademy</strong></a> – although I do not
personally like the way one interacts with the web site, it does
offer an gentle introduction to ruby, javascript, python and other
subjects in an immediate feedback environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs"><strong>Kahn Academy</strong></a> –
learning to program with JavaScript (if you are just starting out,
JS is a fine language to learn. It’s fairly ubiquitous in the online
world.). Their approach is teaching young folks, which might or
might not appeal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://railscasts.com/"><strong>RailsCasts</strong></a> – another super awesome
effort has been put together by Ryan Bates. Current production is on
hiatus, so the $9/month fee for the full screen casts is being
pro-rated, so you can buy in for $9 and there won’t be further
monthly charges until production starts up again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.rubytapas.com/faq"><strong>RubyTapas</strong></a> – Avdi Grimm is a
fabulous Ruby and Rails mentor and guide, who puts out two very
short screen casts a week (tapas – small plates). These are really
impeccably done, and I personally love listening to Avdi talk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://learncodethehardway.org/"><strong>LearnCodeTheHardWay</strong></a> –
provides online versions of books and tutorials for
<a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/"><strong>Python</strong></a>,
<a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/"><strong>Ruby</strong></a>,
<a href="http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/"><strong>C</strong></a>,
<a href="http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/"><strong>SQL</strong></a>,
<a href="http://regex.learncodethehardway.org/book/"><strong>Regular Expressions</strong></a>
and more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.rubykoans.com/"><strong>Ruby Koans</strong></a> – “koans” are an
Eastern discipline tradition: small, repeated exercises to learn
skills and build them into your muscles and memory, so you can use
them without thinking consciously about them. In this sense, the
ruby koans are small exercises intended to lead you on the way to
learning ruby. I can’t say if they’re that successful, but some
people definitely enjoy this progressive way of learning. The ruby
koans definitely guide you in the way of test-first development,
which is a beneficial practice for all to know.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h1>

<p>I am not such a big fan of podcasts, but that has more to do with my personal learning style. Nevertheless, there are some great pocasts out there.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/"><strong>CodeNewbies</strong></a> – started off as a
twitter chat, and grew into a thing, CodeNewbies offers podcasts on
topics that range far and wide. Recent topics have included
Scrum/Agile methods, maintaining your mental health while
programming, interviews with folks who have created significant web
sites (Gina Trapani of LifeHacker!!), mobile, databases, single-page
apps, you name it. One of the best aspects I can see directly is
that this is a <em>very</em> open, diverse collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="teaching-organizations">Teaching Organizations</h1>

<p>These are the ones I’m familiar with at this point in time (late 2015)
in the Twin Cities area:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://frontendmasters.com/"><strong>Frontend Masters</strong></a> – Based out of
Savage, MN, they offer both live in-person and online courses, and
they have recorded all the training sessions for on-demand viewing
if you’re a member. The quality of these sessions and the videos are
extremely good (these are not your twitch.tv live sessions of
someone rambling about their code as they hack away) All the courses
I’ve taken and viewed are fantastic.</p>

    <p>FrontendMasters tackles intermediate and advanced topics in
developing on the front end of web applications. Heavy into
JavaScript, libraries, frameworks, techniques, and so on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Minneapolis/"><strong>Girl Develop It! Minneapolis</strong></a>
serves up training courses mainly in the HTML, CSS, and JS arena,
and is focused on bringing this training to women and other
underrepresented groups. The training sessions are focused on beginners,
which rather fills the gap between the beginner and intermediate.
There are GDI chapeter in several other cities as well. The parent
organization is at <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/">https://www.girldevelopit.com/</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="bootcamps">Bootcamps</h1>

<p>These are becoming quite popular, if expensive, but they seem to
provide what’s being offered: intensive training in the skills
necessary to become a web application developer, with experience and
skills in the entire lifecycle of modern software development. I can’t
really provide much information on them, as I’ve never experienced
them. <a href="http://www.bootcamps.in/">Bootcamps.in</a> provides at least a
first-glance at several bootcamps.</p>

<h1 id="conferences-and-meetups">Conferences and Meetups</h1>

<p>Going to conferences, hanging out, meeting like-minded people, and
generally instilling one’s self into the millieau of the Ruby and
Rails communities can be extremely rewarding. Even if you’re not the
conference type, make an effort to find people in your area to talk
to.</p>

<p>If you’re ever in the Minneapolis area, look me up at
<a href="http://www.rails.mn/">Rails.MN</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby.mn/">Ruby.MN</a>
– I attend those pretty regularly (weather permitting).</p>

<p>I also “run” the weekly <strong>Toast and Tech</strong> meetup from
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Minneapolis/">GDI Minneapolis</a>
on Tuesdays at the
<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/canteen-3255-minneapolis-2">Canteen</a>. Stop
on by and have wonderful toast, coffee, and working with a bunch of
wonderful folks learning web and other development.</p>

<h1 id="more-advanced">More Advanced</h1>

<p>If you want to go deep and learn more about computer science, the book
<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"><em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em></a>
is probably your best bet in terms of a real CS text book that’s
available online for free. It’s not a tutorial, but there are
exercises in the text. The book uses Scheme, a lisp-like
programming language. Everyone should learn a little lisp at some
point. :) However it’s not mandatory one use Scheme (or Clojure as the
local Clojure user group has been doing). The analytical concepts
apply across all languages. If you’re focused on JavaScript or Ruby,
you can work the examples in those languages, too.</p>
