	  for more explanation of "micro clearfix".
	</p>
	<p>
	  Using floats sometimes creates a problem in your web
	  page. Floats do not have any defined height in the page, and so if
	  you want a block of text to appear after all the floats, you need
	  to clear the floats. This sometimes means you'll need to place
	  another <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> after all the floats just to place the "clear: both"
	  and get rid of floating.
	</p>
	<p>
	  But this also creates another problem in remembering and
	  inserting the extra div, plus, it's extra markup -- who needs
	  that?
	</p>

	<p>
	  So, some super CSS gurus came up with the concept of a
	  clearfix class that you can just add to a block element to
	  ensure all floats within that element get cleared properly.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This is called the "clearfix".
	</p>

	<p>
	  This particular method is the micro clearfix by Nick
	  Gallagher. It's probably the smallest amount of code to
	  enable this.

    </header>
    <section class="hero clearfix">
      <div class="container">
	<img src="http://placekitten.com/200/800" class="" alt="" />
      </div>
      <div class="container">
	<p class="text-red">
	  The problem here is that the main text is not long enough to
	  push out the bottom beyond the image floated on the
	  right. Without the <code>.clearfix</code> class, you cannot
	  see the bottom of the <code>img</code>. When you add the
	  <code>.clearfix</code> class to the containing element
	  wrapping both parts, you're now able to get to the bottom of
	  things.

	  Paw at your fat belly hide when guests come over, for sleep
	  nap eat a plant, kill a hand yet shove bum in owner's face
	  like camera lens. Lounge in doorway jump off balcony, onto
	  stranger's head. If it smells like fish eat as much as you
	  wish refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass or
	  give attitude. Run outside as soon as door open. Behind the
	  couch under the bed, for claw drapes.

	  staring . Chew on cable eat and than sleep on your face tuxedo
	  cats always looking dapper. Hunt anything that moves make
	  meme, make cute face mark territory, and leave hair
	  everywhere, and gnaw the corn cob but ignore the squirrels,
	  you'll never catch them anyway.
