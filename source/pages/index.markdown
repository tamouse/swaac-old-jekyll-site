* [Links]({{ site.baseurl | append: "/pages/links/" }})

*****



This area can be used for static web site pages that aren't blog
posts, such as a colophon, an "about me" or "about this blog" page,
collections of information, documentation, notes, etc.

It's certainly possible to make your entire site about non-blog static
pages as well, such as a recipe / cookbook site, or a knowledge base,
or even a replacement for a wiki.

The `navbar` front matter page variable determines whether this page
will be included in the navigation bar on the site. Omit it or set it
to false and it won't show up.

A good practice here is to provide a table of contents into the rest
of the pages.
