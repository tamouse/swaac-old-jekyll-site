The role that passwords play in securing an [application] is often underestimated and overlooked. Passwords provide the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your organization. 

Weak passwords provide attackers with easy access to your computers and network, while strong passwords are considerably harder to crack, even with the password-cracking software that is available today. Password-cracking tools continue to improve, and the computers that are used to crack passwords are more powerful than ever. Password-cracking software uses one of three approaches: intelligent guessing, dictionary attacks, and brute-force automated attacks that try every possible combination of characters. Given enough time, the automated method can crack any password. However, strong passwords are much harder to crack than weak passwords. A secure computer has strong passwords for all user accounts.

A weak password:

* Is no password at all.
* Contains your user name, real name, or company name.
* Contains a complete dictionary word. For example, Password is a weak password.

A strong password:

* Is at least seven characters long.
* Does not contain your user name, real name, or company name.
* Does not contain a complete dictionary word.
* Is significantly different from previous passwords. Passwords that increment (Password1, Password2, Password3 ...) are not strong.
* Contains characters from each of the following four groups:
 
| Character Group | Examples |
|:---------------:|:--------:|
|Uppercase letters|A ... Z|
|Lowercase letters|a ... z|
|Numerals|0 ... 9|
|Symbols found on the keyboard (all keyboard characters not defined as letters or numerals)|` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = { } \| \ : " ; ' < > ? , . /|
|||



An example of a strong password is `J*p2leO4>`.

A password can meet most of the criteria of a strong password but still be rather weak. For example, `Hello2U!` is a relatively weak password even though it meets most of the criteria for a strong password and also meets the complexity requirements of password policy. `H!elZl2o` is a strong password because the dictionary word is interspersed with symbols, numbers, and other letters. It is important to educate users about the benefits of using strong passwords and to teach them how to create passwords that are actually strong.
