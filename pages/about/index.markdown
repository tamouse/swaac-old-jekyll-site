Welcome to [my] "SWAAC" blog!

What is <abbr title="Software as a Craft" class="initialism">"SWAAC"</abbr>? <strong>Software as a Craft!</strong>

I am a firm believer that software development is primarily a craft,
that is, it involves skills, knowledge, creativity, problem-solving
and critical thinking skill, and a deeply personal desire to make
things.

I [wrote a post on this]({{"/swaac/2013/08/03/programmers-creativity/index.html" | prepend: site.baseurl}}) back in 2013:

> What does it mean to be creative? It usually means making something
> that other's can see as beautiful, or as unique, but also it means
> applying your mind to making something real that exists only at first
> in your mind.

Several of the posts you'll find here were originally in my
[personal blog] and copied over here. I've decided what I really want
is a curated set of my writing on SWAAC, so here we are.
