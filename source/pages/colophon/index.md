This site was built using
the
[Jekyll Twitter Bootstrap template][jekyll-twitter-bootstrap-template],
created by [Tamara Temple][tamouse]. It includes elements of [Jekyll],
[Twitter Bootstrap], and [FontAwesome].

Recently (4 Sep 2017), I redesigned the site to remove the sticky
headers and footers. I've become quite disenchanted with them since
they make it difficult read an article simply by paging through with
the space bar.

Additionally, I'm using flexbox more and more. Eventually, I may
completely strip out the bootstrap stuff.

Special thanks to @jaybe (at irc://freenode.net/#jekyll) and [@parkr][parkr] for all their help, interest, and encouragement.

This site works with [Jekyllpress] as well.
