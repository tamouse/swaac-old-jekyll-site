<h2 id="proverb-2-think-first-program-later">Proverb #2: Think First, Program Later</h2>

<p>This proverb doesn’t need much updating, it’s still a fairly popular
proverb, oft-spoken. It really goes hand in hand
with
<a href="/programming/2017/07/29/pp-1-define-the-problem-completely/">the first proverb</a> in
that you have to think about what you’re doing, or going to do, before
you begin it, in order to define the problem.</p>

<p>But it does go a bit further as well.</p>

<p>When given a story, feature, item, etc., that has a definition of the
problem, oft times we jump right in and start to implement it. But
there’s still questions to answer, even before that point, such as</p>

<ul>
  <li>how will I write this?</li>
  <li>where will it go?</li>
  <li>is it already solved somewhere else?</li>
  <li>is there a better way to do this?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-will-i-write-this">How will I write this?</h2>

<p>Thinking about the algorithm or steps to complete the solution is
important. In the next proverb, “Use the top-down approach”, Ledgard
expresses this more completely, but even before that point, you want
to think through the approach to writing the code. This includes the
decision of whether you will follow TDD, or if you need to spike
something first, or if you need to go off and learn something more
about the problem, technology, language, environment, etc., perhaps
you should go write a small “toy” application that solves the problem
in a simpler context to get an understanding of the approach, etc.</p>

<h2 id="where-will-it-go">Where will it go?</h2>

<p>Organizing code is something worth thinking about before writing
it. There are lots of ways to organize code. Some may be determined by
the frameworks and languages you’re using, but even in those there
isn’t necessarily an exact location and so it requires your judgment
of the best place to put the code.</p>

<p>Along with this, you need to decide where the test will live. Again,
testing frameworks may give you a lot of the answers, but it’s still
necessary to think about it.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-already-solved-somewhere-else">Is it already solved somewhere else?</h2>

<p>If something has been solved before, it’s often easier and simpler to
take that implementation and incorporate it. This isn’t always so, but
it’s worth looking. Reasons you want to do this include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the existing solution is proof that it can be done</li>
  <li>it can save the time in the iteration</li>
  <li>the existing solution can provide a blueprint for the current
solution if it can’t be directly used</li>
</ul>

<p>Reasons you may not want to use an existing solution are numerous, of
course, but those reasons shouldn’t preclude looking for one.</p>

<h2 id="is-there-a-better-way-to-do-this">Is there a better way to do this?</h2>

<p>When we approach a problem, we often only think of one way the problem
can be solved. There is a maxim called “Do the simplest thing that
works” that in practice often just turns into “Do the first thing you
can think of.” When you arrive at a way to solve a problem, ask
yourself if you can think of another way to do it. How can you make it
simpler?</p>

<p>Test-driven development is a way to think through how to solve the
problem, but even here it’s tempting to start writing the test code
too early. Take a moment to write down just the test statements
themselves, such as:</p>

<p>“it renders an enabled, green submit button when all the required
fields are set”</p>

<p>The act of writing out the test cases gives you a much better idea of
how you’ll solve the problem.</p>

<p>You might consider writing them not in a code file, but in a text
file, or even writing them in a notebook by hand. (Yes, archaic.)
But separating the thinking from doing is important enough that
changing the way the thoughts are recorded can help.</p>

<h2 id="other-questions">Other questions</h2>

<p>The questions above are most definitely <em>not</em> the only questions to
consider before moving on to coding. Develop your own set of
questions, create a practice for yourself of asking those questions
and finding new ones to ask when you find the need.</p>

<p>I can guarantee these aren’t the only questions I ask, either. Here’s
a few more:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How will I give input to the item?</li>
  <li>How will I provide the results?</li>
  <li>What information do I need besides the direct input?</li>
  <li>What items need to be configurable?</li>
  <li>Do I need to worry about environmental differences?</li>
  <li>Is there anything I need to be concerned about when operationalizing
this?</li>
  <li>Are there compositional parts of the solution I want to have be
interchangeable (i.e. via dependency injection, etc)?</li>
  <li>What implementation decisions should I postpone until run time?
Which have to be determined at compile time? Which have to be
determined at deployment?</li>
</ul>

<p>And a couple of meta questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What questions are important to answer now? later?</li>
  <li>What questions should I be asking?</li>
  <li>What questions have I not considered?</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the later proverbs should also provide questions to think
about up front.</p>

<h2 id="more-thought-yields-less-code">More thought yields less code</h2>

<p>I believe, ultimately, that the intent here is directly related to the
idea that the less code you have to write, the better. The more you
think the problem through before writing code, the fewer false starts
and abandoned lines of code you’ll have.</p>
