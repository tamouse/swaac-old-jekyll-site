Matt provides a great little tutorial on
the sectioning elements in HTML5; what they're for and when to use
them.

The article may be a year old, but the information is still
current. Sectioning HTML pages is important for understanding the
structure of a page. While most visual users will never notice, those
using screen readers and voice over/text-to-speech systems will. They
also provide a good sense for designing the elements of a page, and
thinking about the content you're creating.

## The section elements discussed

* main
* article
* section
* nav
* aside
* header
* footer
* address
