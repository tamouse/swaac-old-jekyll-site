title: Resources for learning how to program, especially how to program in Ruby and Rails
date: 2015-05-31 18:11

Many
people ask me "How do I learn to program?" and "What book(!) should I
read to learn Rails?".

These are legitimate questions, but they aren't necessarily the right
questions to ask in order to begin the journey of becoming a software
craftsperson.

Better questions, I feel, are:

* What resources do you recommend for beginners?
* Where can I go for help?

I've been finding things around the 'net that can greatly help people
new to programming, new to web development, new to Rails, and so on.

*******

This is a quick, short list of things. I urge you to seek them out,
and seek out others as well, and create your *own* list of learning
resources. People will begin to ask you, and it's nice to have
something handy.

Also, [learning Rails is hard](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/this-is-why-learning-rails-is-hard).
But don't despair! The key to learning is break things down, focusing
and practicing small things, and build up a lot of skills
slowly. ("Wax on, wax off." "Ok, Mr. Myagi.") I'm going to jump ahead
and tell you to download the first chapter (free) of Justin Weiss's
book
[Practicing Rails](https://www.justinweiss.com/practicing-rails/). Search
for "first chapter" and fill out the form to get it. You're also
signing up to get e-mail from Justin, but it's always good stuff.

*Update Sun Jun 8 11:39:13 2014:* Recently came across web post
 [Best Way To Learn Ruby and Rails](http://astonj.com/tech/best-way-to-learn-ruby-rails/)
 and must say it is a great compilation of resources. In addition,
 Ashton puts the focus right at the heart of the matter: you have
 learn *both* Ruby *and* Rails.

# Books

* [**Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13590009-think-like-a-programmer)
  by V. Anton Spraul.

  Spraul's purpose in this book is not to teach you how to write a
  program, but to begin to understand the problem-solving approach
  that is inherent in good programmers. Like so many skills,
  programming is driven by the desire and vision of the
  practitioner. A painter uses brushes, canvas, paints, other media to
  create a work of art, but it isn't the tools, it isn't the specific
  techniques, and it isn't even the particular skill the painter has
  that makes a good work of art; it is their composition, the melding
  of media and surface, the use of different techniques, and practice
  in developing the skills that come together to form the work of
  art. Spraul is going to take you deeper than just the syntax,
  semantics, and data structures of software to the heart of what
  makes a good programmer: the ability to creatively find and generate
  solutions to problems.

* [**Learn to Program**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/520.Learn_to_Program)
  by Chris Pine.

  To be honest, I have not looked through this book. It is, however,
  nearly universally recommended to people new to programming. The
  original tutorial is available online for free as well:
  [https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). LtP
  was featured on the great webcomic
  [Unshelved](http://www.unshelved.com/2014-7-25).

* [**A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language)
  by Christopher Alexander.

  You may be wondering why I've included a book on building
  construction. The answer is quite simple: the concepts in building
  towns and houses is nearly directly translatable to building
  software applications and systems. One part of being an excellent
  craftsperson is being able to apply abstract learning in different
  problem domains. If you are an expert in writing software, you are
  almost *never* going to be solving problems only for other software
  developers. (You can and should do so, but the client and users are
  generally non-programmers.) Thus you're most likely going to be
  working in someone else's domain of expertise. Alexander's views on
  architecture apply to software architecture as well.

## Ruby-specific

* [**Eloquent Ruby**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9364729-eloquent-ruby)
  by Russ Olsen.

  Olsen's approach in this book is to go far beyond just learning a
  programming language, but a way to learning the idioms and the "Ruby
  Way". Even if your chosen language is something other than Ruby,
  reading this book will give you an appreciation for how to delve
  into a language and get the most out of it.

* [**Confident Ruby**](http://www.confidentruby.com/) by Avdi Grimm.

  More than any other book I've read on Ruby, "Confident Ruby" has
  affected my coding habits more than any other. If Ruby is about
  making programmers happy, *Confident Ruby* is about making
  programming joyful, and not just in the immediate, but being able to
  look at code you've written in the future and recall the
  joy. *Confident Ruby* seeks to combat software rot from the get-go.

* [**Well-Grounded Rubyist**](http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1617291692)
  by David A. Black

  Also known as the "Black Book" (because of the author's name), WGR
  is the successor to _Ruby for Rails_ by Black that provided me with
  the much-needed introduction to how to write Ruby code, with the
  idea of using it in Ruby for Rails. This book is a fabulous primer
  on the Ruby idioms and expressions that help make one a good Ruby
  programmer.

* [**Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby**](http://www.poodr.com/)
  by Sandi Metz

  This book provides a deeply-needed introduction to object-oriented
  design, specifically targeted to the Ruby language. Ruby is one of
  the richest languages in which to express object-oriented patterns,
  but it is easy to fall of the OO wagon and start to get things
  messed up. Sandi provides the thinking tools necessary to decide how
  to structure your code for better maintainability, extensibility and
  testability. Comprehension and forward communication of the choices
  made during software design are crucial to programming, and Sandi is
  one of the very best at explaining things.

## Rails-specific

* [**Rails 4 in Action**](http://www.manning.com/bigg2/) by Ryan Bigg,
  Yehuda Katz, Steve Klabnik, and Rebecca Skinner.

  A follow-on the highly successful Rails 3 in Action, R4iA has been
  completely rewritten, with new examples, case study, and all the
  great new features in Rails 4.

  A great book for beginning Rails developers to start with, and for
  intermediate developers to step up their game.

* [**Practicing Rails**](https://www.justinweiss.com/practicing-rails/)
   by [Justin Weiss](http://www.justinweiss.com).

  The first chapter alone (free!) is worth a download and very
  thorough read. Justin has provided one of the most effective
  strategies for learning just about *anything* skill based, and it's
  especially effective for learning software skills. The focus of the
  book and the examples and such are obviously Rails, but the first
  chapter is applicable to anything.

## JavaScript-specific

* [**JavaScript: The Good Parts**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2998152-javascript)
  by David Crockford.

  JavaScript is a vast, sprawling language and ecosystem, and has been
  maligned for much poor code on the web. Crockford extracts out the
  parts that are really useful, giving the reader a better
  grounding. This book is the progenitor of many of the JavaScript
  frameworks that have come up the past few years, as well as
  CoffeeScript and other *Script derivatives.

* [**You Don't Know JS series**](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
  by [Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify).

  A *tour de force* by one of the great teachers and evangelists of
  JavaScript, Kyle's "You Don't Know JS" series is a must-read
  collection of books. You can get the books in raw form on-line at
  the above address, and you can get the published e-books at your
  favourite vendor.

* [**Eloquent Javascript**](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn
  Haverbeke.

  When I was more naive about JS, I wrote a bit of a negative review
  of this book. Subsequently, I've learned of it's true eloquence and
  meaning in giving a model of how to organize and implement modern
  JS. The subtitle "A modern introduction to programming" is still a
  bit misleading, perhaps, because you have to understand a fair bit
  of JavaScript *and* programming to get the message, I feel. But
  that's just a quibble at this point. Read this before you strike out
  on creating a client-based JS application; you won't regret it.

# Web sites

This is just going to be a list of sites I've found or been pointed at
for helping people learn to program. These are most definitely biased
towards Ruby and Rails, as that is my current area of concentration,
and generate the most requests that come to me.

* [**The Odin Project**](http://www.theodinproject.com/home) --
  pulling together a curriculum from around the web, this is a
  curation site that gives order and structure to learning how to
  develop web applications.

* [**Exercism.IO**](http://exercism.io/) -- a site devoted to helping
  people learn and think deeply about writing excellent code. It has
  projects you implement and then get feedback on from others, and
  allows you to give feedback as well.

* [**RailsBridge**](http://docs.railsbridge.org/docs/) -- a site
  devoted to helping people get up and running on learning Ruby on
  Rails, with emphasis on reaching out to women and LGBTQ
  folks. RailsBridge workshops are run around the world and the
  documents here can be used individually to help turn your computer
  into a development machine. What so often isn't addressed directly
  by very many of these sites and books is the ecosystem that one has
  to learn as well: a coding editor, the command line, rake, irb/pry,
  git, heroku if that is your choice for deployment (which I do
  recommend for small beginner projects so you can show it off to your
  friends); RailsBridge tutorials include these very important tools.

* [**RailsGirls Guides**](http://guides.railsgirls.com/) -- I haven't
  explored these in depth yet, I just got the site yesterday. However,
  I can see just from the list of guides these would be pretty great,
  just like the RailsBridge site above.

* [**Hartl's Rails Tutorial**](http://www.railstutorial.org/) -- the
  most often recommended site to learn how to create web applications
  in Rails, it goes beyond the Rails stack itself, teaching Ruby,
  HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, user authentication and authorization, data
  modeling, and so on. While Michael sells the book, tutorials, and
  screen casts, the text of the tutorial online is free at
  http://www.railstutorial.org/book. Considerable work has gone into
  this effort, however, so if you can afford to, please purchase at
  least the book.

* [**CodeSchool**](https://www.codeschool.com/) -- learn from the
  "Comfort of your own browser". Codeschool has web casts, coding
  practices, challenges, and so on.

* [**CodeAcademy**](http://codeacademy.com) -- although I do not
  personally like the way one interacts with the web site, it does
  offer an gentle introduction to ruby, javascript, python and other
  subjects in an immediate feedback environment.

* [**Kahn Academy**](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs) --
  learning to program with JavaScript (if you are just starting out,
  JS is a fine language to learn. It's fairly ubiquitous in the online
  world.). Their approach is teaching young folks, which might or
  might not appeal.

* [**RailsCasts**](http://railscasts.com/) -- another super awesome
  effort has been put together by Ryan Bates. Current production is on
  hiatus, so the $9/month fee for the full screen casts is being
  pro-rated, so you can buy in for $9 and there won't be further
  monthly charges until production starts up again.

* [**RubyTapas**](http://www.rubytapas.com/faq) -- Avdi Grimm is a
  fabulous Ruby and Rails mentor and guide, who puts out two very
  short screen casts a week (tapas -- small plates). These are really
  impeccably done, and I personally love listening to Avdi talk.

* [**LearnCodeTheHardWay**](http://learncodethehardway.org/) --
  provides online versions of books and tutorials for
  [**Python**](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/),
  [**Ruby**](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/),
  [**C**](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/),
  [**SQL**](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/),
  [**Regular Expressions**](http://regex.learncodethehardway.org/book/)
  and more.

* [**Ruby Koans**](http://www.rubykoans.com/) -- "koans" are an
  Eastern discipline tradition: small, repeated exercises to learn
  skills and build them into your muscles and memory, so you can use
  them without thinking consciously about them. In this sense, the
  ruby koans are small exercises intended to lead you on the way to
  learning ruby. I can't say if they're that successful, but some
  people definitely enjoy this progressive way of learning. The ruby
  koans definitely guide you in the way of test-first development,
  which is a beneficial practice for all to know.

# Bootcamps

These are becoming quite popular, if expensive, but they seem to
provide what's being offered: intensive training in the skills
necessary to become a web application developer, with experience and
skills in the entire lifecycle of modern software development. I can't
really provide much information on them, as I've never experienced
them. [Bootcamps.in](http://www.bootcamps.in/) provides at least a
first-glance at several bootcamps.

# Conferences and Meetups

Going to conferences, hanging out, meeting like-minded people, and
generally instilling one's self into the millieau of the Ruby and
Rails communities can be extremely rewarding. Even if you're not the
conference type, make an effort to find people in your area to talk
to.

If you're ever in the Minneapolis area, look me up at
[TC Rails Hack Night](http://www.tchacknight.com/),
[Rails.MN](http://www.rails.mn/), and [Ruby.MN](http://www.ruby.mn/)
-- I attend those pretty regularly (weather permitting).
